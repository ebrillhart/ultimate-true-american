# Ultimate True American
####Created by Yahya Hussein, Emma Brillhart, and Tess O'Brien
An app built with Ruby on Rails that facilitates multiple users (the game's creator and several other players with accounts and usernames) playing a game of True American, a drinking game inspired by the show "New Girl".

###How-To
######1. Sign up for an account (you can use Facebook) in order to create games and access games that friends have added you to.
######2. Add friends that you want to play the game with. Players are added by username, so make sure that they have an account in order to have access to the game dashboard.
######3. Read the rules and follow or adapt them as your see fit. We've added three options for what to do during a turn, but feel free to come up with your own to make the game yours.
######4. Set up your game space, gather your materials (read: booze), and get ready to party like a True American!

###User Stories:
######1. One user of True American is a college student who is a big fan of the show New Girl. She always enjoys the episode of new girl where True American is played and has always wanted to find a workable version of the rules and some sort of structure.  She comes across Ultimate True American while looking for a game to play with her college roommate.  She wants a game that is easy to prep for, self explanatory and available on her mobile phone.
######2. Our user is planning a party for his friends around the next political debate.  He is planning to have his friends over to watch the debate and then play a game of true american.  He wants an easy game that is sure to be a party hit, but doesn't require too much set up or everyone to have their computer (and that they can still play when he can't find his old deck of cards).  He is not quite sure how many people are going to show up, so he needs flexibility in the number of players.

###Biggest Challenges
The biggest challenges that we faced with this project were implementing oAuth, adding a player within the game show page, and implementing the beer count feature, which edits the number of beers that a player has consumed. The latter two issues may have been avoided with a slightly different data structure and/or controller structure, but it ended up being a really good learning experience coming up with the work-arounds. If we were to do the project over, we would probably make more use of nested routes.
